A small implementation of Tic Tac Toe. 
The game is implemented in C++ 17 as a text-based game, and the user inputs are done through the debug console. The codes are separated into three classes; 
one class contained the tic tac toe board and a function to save and print each board, and another function to save the gameplay onto a text file. 
The second class contains the gameplay logic such as moving move through searching with minimax search or alpha-beta pruning. The
third class contain a simple implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search.

All six files are needed to run the game.
